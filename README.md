RNR's Not Roblox (*RNR*) is a project that aims to recreate the look and feel of classic Roblox with new features while remaining fully compatible with clients from that era. It is built upon an engine that closely resembles Roblox's own at the time, referencing decompilations of legacy client binaries.

## Features and Goals

There are several goals that RNR seeks to accomplish, them being;

- Native Windows and Linux support
- Easy-to-use (simple command line options to launch and host games, as well as a level editor with a modern UI)
- Fully compatible with Roblox versions up to 0.3.744.0 (dated April 2008) in areas such as hosting, joining, level file serialization, etc.
- Incorporates all the various facets of the Roblox engine with a little bit extra (e.g. a network replication whitelist, fancy shader support, etc.)
- Made using clean-room reverse engineering
- Uses Roblox's [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) as its scripting language while remaining fully compatible with classic Roblox scripts written using Lua 5.1
- As free and open-source as possible (with client code licensed under the GPL and the engine itself being released into the public domain, void of any copyright)
- Patches all the security vulnerabilities and fixing bugs/inefficiencies that legacy Roblox clients had
